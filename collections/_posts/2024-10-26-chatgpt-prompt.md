## Introducing Zoho Deluge: A Gateway to Harnassing Data Science

Picture this: 

## Zoho Deluge and REST API

### Zoho Deluge:

Delugng:
- Built-in functions and wrappers tailored for Zoho applications
- No egrated query capabilities

### REST APIs

Imagine EST APIs <strong>dominate</strong> the API usage space. According to Postman, the number one tool for API management and design, [89%](https://analyzingalpha.com/api-statistics) of respondents in their 2022 survey reported their API architecture to be specifically designed around REST APIs.

RE like ```GET```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, and ```DELETE```. For future coding, remember that REST APIs are stateless. Each client request is independent 


Another important JSON or XML.

## Fdds

For thi to handle.

### User Story
Assume  selects from your provided lists of common weather data points:

- Temperature: Recorded temperature (Â°F)

### Research
briefly discuss my research process so you understand how the code will function further in the walkthrough:

1. We are pulling current data from external sources into Zoho Cliq, so REST APIs will be useful here
2. Open Metro has a free API that can obtain our data desired, but it requires both Longitude (-82.0200) and Latitude (33.5000)

## Project Setup

First, we need

simple enough without requiring any in-depth transformation 

### Design our Zoho

There are plenty of documentation detailing how to access the "Command" build-out tool from the "Bots & Tools" link in Zoho Cliq. Therefore I will not 

## Step 1: invokeURL

With both our API Url createed and our 

To begin, we 

### Is requesting?

Sadly, no. Other this process for any other parameters desired.

## Step 2: Wind

You may have no

## Step 3: Hour

We have now com

## Step 4: Putting it all together

\output a message that looks similar to this (I stylized mine for fun):

## Conclusion


Ye didn't discuss so I hope you take time to research more about this side of programming.
